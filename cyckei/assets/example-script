# This script demonstrates some basic Cyckei functions. For more information, view the help document at Menu > Help.
# This script charges to 4 V at 10 mA, then discharges at 10 mA to 3 V. It then collects data for five minutes without applying voltage or current.
# The cycle is repeated five times.
