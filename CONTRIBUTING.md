# Contributing to Cyckei

---

## Developing Cyckei
Cyckei is an open source project created with the intention of allowing users to customize it to fit their equipment and setup. We encourage users with some programming knowledge to contribute changes that may be helpful to the community.

## Workflow
GitLab hosts and manages version control for the Cyckei source code. The Cyckei project is kept under Cyclikal LLC's account at <https://gitlab.com/cyclikal/cyckei>. To submit patches to the codebase, fork the project to a personal GitLab account and make any desired changes. After completing a bug fix or new feature, open a new merge request into Cyclikal's repository along  with thorough documentation. After review, the patch may integrated into Cyckei's development branch.
